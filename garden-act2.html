        Garden of Gothsemane

        Act 2
        stacked and hollow, their silence ringing with curated grief, bound in ink.
	‘Jude Noir…’ the Headsorrow said, toying with an onyx ring etched with the Ministry’s eye.
He was an old man; wearing a monocle etched with the Ministry’s eye, ever watchful. His hair was streaked grey and black, dyed only halfway, for reasons Jude refused to try and understand.
	I gave up trying to understand this world a while ago… He thought, resisting the urge to slump into his chair lest Miss Ash behind him smacked him with her cane. ‘Yes, Headsorrow?’ Jude answered, voice dipped in just the right amount of anguish. There was no need to perform this time. 
	‘I’ve been told you wrote a poem that was against the conventions of the Ministry of Melancholy,’ the Headsorrow looked towards Miss Ash who grimly nodded. ‘You’ve always been troublesome, but you had the potential to be one of Masters of Melancholy.’ 
	Jude kept his head down, not daring to look towards the Monocle of Melancholy. 
	‘We normally wouldn’t do this to someone not yet inhibited by emotion,’ he said, without the slightest hint of regret. ‘We are going to send you to the Garden… It is time for you to transcend.’
	Jude looked up and rose, glaring at the Monocle of Melancholy. The eye wept tears of welcome underneath a suppressed smirk. Jude’s blood ran cold, but he rose anyway, defiance blooming where fear once ruled, ‘No! Not the Garden!’ 
The Headsorrow tapped a button beneath the lip of his ring. The bookshelves split open, and four corpses in suits emerged from the mist. ‘Take him,’ he said. 
	Jude made to flee, but Miss Ash struck him — and darkness took him. He faded to black and, perhaps, that would be all he would see from now on. 


	A shaded light met Jude’s creaking eyelids as blood rushed back into his twitching limbs. He barely managed to crane his neck upwards toward spiralling black clouds, dripping oil-like rain and screaming with growls of grieving thunder. They circled a giant spire that pierced the heavens, casting a venomous shadow across the path to emotional exile. 
	His mouth was sealed with vacuum tape, and the breaths through his nose were shallow, but just enough to keep his body alive beneath the pelting rain. I’ve seen this before, he thought, eyes scanning the pentagonal enclosure. The Pentagram… Where the Dissolution began. 
	His brow furrowed as a rare spot of colour flickered from the shadows. Are those moonglasses? he wondered, just before the corpses dragged him into the velvety maw of the Spire of Silence.
	The abyss opened up and a spectral gleam frothed from inside. 
‘The Garden awaits,’ a mechanical voice said, humming through the dark.
	I suppose this is it then… he thought, glimpsing a sliver of the sun’s tearful rays peeking through the black clouds. I’ll never see you the same again…


	Jude was dragged through darkness, eyes unable to adjust, ears ringing with the echo of hollow footsteps.
	Another door opened, spilling azure light that crept like jewelled spiders. A firm thrust met his shoulder, and he plummeted into the webbed abyss.
	Then, a hand grabbed him and lifted him up. ‘Forgot about this…’ the corpse said slowly. 
	Rip.
	The vacuum tape ripped free. A stifling heat rushed into his starving lungs. ‘Ow!’ he screamed. 
	The four corpses’ eyes flashed crimson. ‘Emotion level high. Warning level negative one,’ they raised their fist in unison. 
	Jude raised his hands, biting his lip and tensing his face to dam the emotion rising beneath.
	‘Welcome,’ the mechanical voice returned with its all-encompassing rhythm. 
	At the far wall, a rectangular screen glowed — the room’s only light. The eye returned, bleeding words in dripping eyeliner across the pixelated screen: Garden of Gothsemane.
	‘Who are you?’ Jude asked, trying to keep any emotion from his tone. He did not want to find out about warning level negative two. Though, at this point, he wasn’t sure it would be worse than his current fate. 
	‘We are Garden,’ the voice replied – the corpses joined in a haunting crescendo that sent a chill down Jude’s spine. ‘The holy cathedral awaits.’
	In an instant, Jude was slammed to the floor. Cold hands clamped to his neck, shoulders, and knees.
	He tried to scream but he was too afraid to show any more emotion. 
	Something latched on over his head and covered his eyes. 
	The world faded to black. 
	Just before everything vanished, a voice called from behind — haughty and indefatigable: ‘Smile.’ 
	That was the last thing Jude heard. 

	
Black rose petals flickered in digital dissonance beneath the sheen of eclipsed suns. Black doves floated through the space without flapping their wings, simply gliding with no end and no care. 
	Jude sat up and his hands rushed to his head. ‘Nothing there…’ he muttered, scanning his surroundings. 
He jumped, noticing beneath him were white blades of grass with flaming black tips. They didn’t burn – he didn’t feel a thing. So this is how it starts… 
He looked ahead to a path of black grass, careful not to meet the horrent sky’s gaze.
A VR simulation, he thought. A rift split open above. A radiant ego beamed down, cutting the darkness with sickly light.
	Pixels rose from the ground, revealing leather designer boots stamped with the forbidden logo — the deadly smile.
	Oh no… 
	Next, the jeans formed blue as the forbidden sky. Then a sun-yellow shirt. Finally, a shaved head gleaming beneath the abyssal eclipse, crowned by moonglasses sharp enough to cut diamonds. Beneath them a smile so practiced it sent even the digital doves flying. 
	‘So, this is the matrix,’ the man said defiantly, then hummed a forbidden tune: Tourner dans la lumière.
	I hate that I know his theme song, Jude thought shuddering. 
	‘You there,’ he said, grinning. ‘I’m Andrew Fate. I’m here to rescue you.’
	Jude took a step back away from the man’s chilling smile. It never stopped and it seemed his face was trained to always smile. 
	‘Weren’t you supposed to be in prison for the whole SmileCam fiasco?’ Jude took another step back. 
	Fate flexed, ‘Did six months in a greyscale cell. Meditated the whole time. Came out stronger. The matrix can’t hold me.’
	‘You mean the Ministry?’ Jude narrowed his eyes.
	‘Same thing. Anyway, if people get offended by beautiful women smiling at them, maybe the problem’s not the smile.’
	Jude averted his eyes. I hate the fact that made sense. ‘Anyway, do you know what this place is?’ 
	‘The Garden,’ Fate replied, his tone darkening. ‘They threw my brother in here. I’m here to pay them back.’
	Jude looked at him and said, ‘Do you know how to get out then?’ 
	Fate lifted his moonglasses, revealing his razor-like amber eyes, ‘No, all I know is that it’s possible.’
	Jude paused, feeling like he heard something unbelievable, ‘Who could possib—’ 
	‘The Grimtendo Reaper,’ Fate snapped, his shoulders twitching beneath a half-smothered smile.
	Jude fell silent and cautiously pressed, ‘Who is that?’
	‘Don’t ask,’ Fate muttered, eyes darkening. ‘Anyway, my bros saw you recite your poem. I heard it cracked the system.’  
	‘If by that you mean it got me sent straight to Tophet, then yes it did.’ 
	‘Don’t you mean hell?’
	‘Same thing, fool,’ Jude rolled his eyes. 
	Fate’s smile deepened, ‘You’ve got potential. I think we’ll get along just fine.’ 
	That is definitely the last thing I want… 


	Chains of ink bled from the neon sky, dangling from mountains of eyeliner. Reflective dust scattered with each blink from the Ministry’s eye. It watched and watched as it always did. 
	Jude looked up. It’s not that different from our world, he thought. The Garden might even be more honest.
	Fate pointed to a path of dying, ink-stained trees whose whittling arms intertwined into the brittle arches overhead. Vines tangled around the trunks, each tattooed with the word despair in different languages.
	‘You know I speak fourteen languages,’ Fate said, testing the words in a clumsy accent.	Jude tried to ignore him, but it wouldn’t stop the man from preaching. His voice was as insistent as his smile.
	‘This world sucks. You can’t express emotion without it being a crime. You can’t even smile at a girl without them thinking you’re some sort of freak! ‘How are we even supposed to have kids anymore?’ Fate snapped a branch from above and hurled it into the void.
	Jude stopped and turned. ‘I get it — the world sucks. I can’t even talk to a girl I like because I like her. It’s too much emotion. It doesn’t make sense!’ The pain slipped through before he could stop it.
	‘Yes!’ Fate’s moonglasses lit up in the pale glow of the eye above. ‘This world sucks. This is why you need to enrol in Smile University!’ 
	‘A pyramid scheme just contributes to the problem!’ Jude argued, picking up the pace. 
	The Eye above blinked in a warped smile, releasing a stream of digital eyeliner that sent a visceral shudder through Jude.
	The arched path was soon at an end and Jude had seen enough of the word despair to last a lifetime—enough to be forever engrained in him. At the end of the path lay a single dark portal shimmering underneath the glow of starlight. 
	The Eye above looked down, slightly shifting towards the portal in a sinister smile. 
	‘Looks like that’s where the matrix wants us to go,’ Fate stepped ahead, his smile beaming back at it. He turned to Jude, ‘You should try smiling sometime.’
Jude gave him the finger — and grinned.
	He pushed past him and entered the ethereal portal.


	Church bells rang into the void. Jude and Fate reassembled from the feet up, pixel by pixel.
Light pierced bleeding bricks, leaking black blood past stained glass depictions of Malisan Ransom. His eyes were hollow but were weeping and managed to follow both Fate and Jude wherever they moved. 
The Eye always watches… Jude thought, adjusting again to being seen.
Other windows showed Christ turning water into eyeliner, then feeding his apostles his blackened heart.
	‘This is quite horrifying,’ Jude said, looking around for an escape route. There was no door in the church, just another stained-glass window with the depiction of a dead sun streaking rays of chains that crawled all around the walls and roof. They pulsed like a sickening heartbeat.
	He looked ahead to the altar, lit by a single flickering candle. Beneath it, stairs descended into a strangely comforting abyss.
	‘I guess that’s the only way to go,’ he said, looking back at Fate.
	Fate looked at one of the pieces of art of a woman dressed in fishnets screaming into an ocean with bleeding knees buried into a black sand beach. She was facing the ocean, kneeling in prayer. Her hair was long and covered her nude back, resting and rooting within the sand itself. ‘That’s strange… she’s showing emotion,’ Fate muttered. His smile didn’t falter.
	‘Yet no one’s listening,’ Jude said, already heading for the stairs.
	The descent stretched longer than either of them expected. The only light present was that of Fate’s golden smile. 
	‘What did you put on your teeth for them to glow like that?’ Jude asked.
	‘Emotion,’ Fate said — then, for the first time, fell silent until they reached the bottom.
	Clap. 
	Clap.
	Clap.
	Thunderous applause met them, followed by a searing white light that burned their eyes. Both Jude and Fate recoiled and fell to their knees.
	‘Isn’t the light awful?’ said a digital voice, echoing from every corner.
	His eyes managed to open, and he was met with the faces of all of his classmates smiling at him and clapping. ‘Isn’t this so very strange?’ The voice smirked. 
	A shudder ran through Jude as he watched Desparia wink at him and blow him a kiss. The kiss ran through him like a razor blade, cutting apart his sensitive insides – striking where he was most vulnerable.
	‘So, that’s the girl you like, eh?’ Fate pulled Jude to his feet and patted him on the back. ‘That’s what a woman’s supposed to do for a man.’
	‘But that’s not her… She would never do that.’ Jude shook his head, stomach churning.
	‘The world made her this way, Jude. If the Ministry didn’t exist, this is exactly what she would be doing. She would be smiling.’ Fate’s tone was almost hypnotic.
	‘No.’ Jude brushed Fate’s hand off his back. ‘You can’t say that for sure. People are what they are.’ 
	‘Then why do you feel so burdened by the world?’ Fate’s eyebrows narrowed.
	‘I’m not…’ Jude looked at Desparia’s hollow reflection once more. ‘I’m not.’
	‘You see,’ the digital voice returned. ‘Emotion just isn’t right. It causes us to feel all sorts of unpleasant things. Life is better without them.’ 
	The crowd vanished in an instant — mercifully. Jude narrowed his eyes, watching Desparia’s fading smile replaced by a new portal. Jude took a breath, steadying himself. ‘Let’s keep going.’
	‘Remember to smile,’ Fate said, following behind. ‘It’ll keep you strong in this world.’
	The light in Jude’s eyes flickered – tinged with pixelated hesitation – as he stepped into the next abyss.


	Crimson light seeped from a bleeding eyelid above, raining blood over a wasteland of decay. Bodies lay dormant, crumbling into fragments of skeletal dust. 
The Eye spoke: ‘What do you see before you?’ Its iris shifted with a bleaching squelch that churned Jude’s stomach. He would have been sick—his insides screamed for him to do so. 
This isn’t a real body… He remembered, thinking back to his limp body on the floor of the
Spire. 
	Fate stepped ahead, his smile lighting the way. ‘This is all fake,’ he said, aiming his words at Jude. 
	‘Everything here is fake — filtered through memory and experience,’ the voice said. So, what do you see, Jude Noir?’
	Jude looked up at the hellscape beyond, cataracts of flame pierced the ground in violent ecstasy, spurting embers of decay upon already ashen bodies. ‘Is this war…?’ He asked, thinking back to his history classes.
	‘Correct. War is something that used to exist with emotions. Anger, fear and pride were the main perpetrators. Without them, we no longer have scenes like this.’ The eye closed and the voice faded. 
	Hell vanished, but the memory stained Jude’s mind forever.
	Another portal opened. 
	Is this why emotions were banished…? 
	Even Fate kept silent as they both walked through the next portal. 


	Jude stood in his room, facing the slightly off-kilter mirror where he practiced his non-smiles every morning. Fate was behind him, sat on his bed, looking out towards the
sun.
	His reflection was strange – almost too perfect – and, despite him actually trying, he now found it very difficult to smile. His eyes were hollowing, his hand drifting toward the locked safe on top of his cupboard. He opened it and found the eyeliner he got for his sixteenth birthday – a gift from Desparia. 
	Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. I could finally go on a date with her… He plucked the lid off the eyeliner and watched it drip with tears of a life he was soon to leave behind. 
	‘What do you think you’re doing?!’ Fate grabbed the eyeliner off him and chucked it against the mirror. It cracked, reflecting Jude’s crumbling psyche.
	‘I just thought it would be easier…’ he said, hands quivering. 
	‘That’s what they want you to think!’ Fate shoved him toward the window, where mournful sunlight spilled across the room. ‘Do you really want to hate this?’
	Jude pulled his hand free, ‘I don’t! Dammit!’ Tears began to form in his eyes. ‘I just want to be me…’ he admitted, dropping down to his bed, clutching his covers. 
	‘I can help you be free…’ Fate slithered forward, his serpentine smile dripping with promise. ‘Work with me. With your power — your poetry — we could save this emotionless world!’	Jude looked up at Fate – his outline shimmering in the rays of the digital sun. He motioned to move his hand towards him. 
	‘We can rule the world. Imagine the amount of power you’ll have as the Messiah! Together we’d build an empire so large the world will be filled with smiles!’ 
	Jude retracted his hand, ‘That’s not what I want either!’ He stood up and began to move downstairs. 
	Fate chased after him with more and more promises, but Jude began to block his voice out. 
	His husks that were his parents weren’t downstairs, but a portal remained by the candlelit table.
	I just want to write poems, man. 
	Torn between worlds, he stepped through to the final stages of the Garden.
