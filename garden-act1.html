        Garden of Gothsemane

        Act 1 
        	Beneath aberrant streetlights, irreverent butterflies danced in anticipation of the coming night. Headphones blared melodious rapture in a symphony of lonely walks beneath the emerging moon.
Jude peered outside, soaking in the dying rays of the twilit sun as they brushed his melancholic smile.
The clouds gathered, veiling the light of the stars, bringing the true night. And with night came supposed life and with that life came suffering smiles. 
The insufferable hiss of static scraped through the room when Jude unlocked his phone. 
‘Here we have famous HuskTuber Ariana!’ A video began playing on his phone. ‘She has made a splash in the abyssal pool of our lives with her Ministry-approved poetry.’
Jude rolled his eyes, she used to be so good...
‘Excuse me,’ Ariana’s voice drone – a monotone melody of manufactured grief, ‘Please refer to me as BTGGF/Noct/Raven please. I’ve been to the Garden. I’ve transcended my base form.’ 
Jude shut the phone off and sighed. He peered through the flapping curtains at the ever-watchful moon, ‘I hate the invasive glare of the night.’ 

	
	Whispers of a cold breeze sang through the cracks of Jude’s window. He rolled from side to side, trying to breathe deeply and lull himself to sleep, but his mind was racing with thoughts of school tomorrow.  
	Oh, come on brain, I do not want to watch another video, he thought, reaching for his phone anyway and checking the time. 03:33. He sighed deeply, resting his back against the headboard. Can’t sleep anyway… 
	He unlocked his phone and fell into the fated HuskTube spiral, scrolling past unreaction after unreaction. He lingered on one: Unreact to Andrew Fate’s best tips to staying happy.  
	‘Everyone’s always got to pick a side,’ he yawned. ‘Well, hopefully I can sleep this time.’ 
	He closed the app and went on his notes, looking over the poems he’d written for his class tomorrow. Hopefully none of these will get me sent to the Garden. He scrolled down further, looking at a file named: Poems for Desparia. His cheeks flushed and he buried his face into his pillow. Why did I write these?! He reached for his phone and hovered over the delete button.
	His hand froze. The silence between heartbeats heavy with the chains of suppression.  
	He threw his phone somewhere on his bed and buried his head deep into his pillows again.


	A muffled alarm went off from underneath Jude’s arm that sent a pleasant shiver through his waking form. He rummaged through his crumpled sheets and fished out his phone. ‘How did I snooze my alarm again?’ he moaned, looking at the time. 
	Dressed in dreary black, he stood before the mirror and rehearsed his deadpan expression. A smile crept through as he adjusted his jacket. ‘Can’t be doing that,’ he sighed
	He repressed the joy and opened the curtains to the soft glow of a lucent sun, its light tempered by glimmers of sadness.
	He walked downstairs into shaded rooms that kept the sorrowful sunlight from breaching the sanctity of their domestic fortress. His parents sat at the table lit by a single, flickering candlelight underneath a shaded lantern.
	Both draped in black, their pasty skin whiter than ghouls. Eyeliner inked into their very souls whilst their thinning ebon hair fluttered in the darkness. 
	‘You up late,’ his mother said, her voice as still as life on the Styx. ‘Were you listening to My Biological Affair all night again?’ 
	Jude shook his head, ‘I don’t listen to that shit.’ His tone slightly elevated. 
	‘Jude!’ his father snapped, voice flat as a grave. ‘Too loud. We don’t use emotion in this house.’ 
	Jude just sat at the table and didn’t say another word. He ate his eggs, drank his ash black tea and watched the candlelight flicker over the hollow eyes of his creators. 
	‘Silence is good. Silence hides the pain,’ his mother said. ‘That’s what the Garden has taught us.’ 
	He pushed the creaking chair back as he stood up and placed his dishes in the abyss washer. 
	‘I’ll see you both tonight,’ he said. There was no need to suppress a smile. 
	‘May the Garden watch over you,’ they both said in haunting unison. 


	He slid out of the door, taking care not to let too much light bother his creators’ peace. I wonder how they met when they can barely leave the house… 
	The sun shone its silvery rays atop of Jude’s welcoming face, he looked up, closed his eyes and soaked in the blessing. 
	He opened his eyes and looked around with a sigh of relief. No one’s around. 
 	The blaring heat settled deep into the fibres of his ebon garb, causing him to sweat just after taking a few steps. He looked around the street to see others dressed in black hoods, shading their precious alabaster hides. 
	A rattle of piercings echoed past, heralding the passing of a group of girls in fishnets with sunken eyes weeping eyeliner like black blood.
	A flush met his cheek when he looked at one of them, but he quickly turned away. Can’t afford to show too much colour, he thought, eyes glancing at the fishnet stockings passing by. She was cute… But if I talk to her then I’ll be showing too much emotion. If I didn’t feel that way, I wouldn’t want to talk to her. He scratched his head, repeating the same thoughts he did every time he saw a cute girl. 
	He kept walking, almost bumping into people who didn’t watch where they were going. He looked at the crossing and saw the black light was on the happy man. Time to stop… He looked around at the sea of black cars with tinted windows, blasting music that soothed aching souls. Or keeps them aching… He thought as the light changed to the sad man. Time to move. 
The streets leading to school were much the same, steeped in shadows with teenagers smoking cigarettes and talking about their favourite HuskTuber videos as Jude walked by. Yet, that was not all he saw, there was a group of rambunctious, rebellious teenagers hanging out near the basketball court. The colours of their shirts sang like sirens in the ocean. Forbidden. Beautiful. Dangerous. 
‘If you want to be indefatigably happy, then you have to do five hundred smiles a day. If you don’t, you’re a pussy!’ A voice blared from one of their phones. 
Andrew Fate… Jude rolled his eyes, but saw the group look at him with disgust. He looked them in the eye and shrugged. They whispered something amongst one another and nodded towards him. Probably not used to people looking them in the eye… I hope they don’t think I’m one of them. 
Jude sighed. A cluster of students in black nearby echoed him, barely aware they did. He shook his head and kept walking. Just get me to school already. 


The ebon gates of the school were forged from adamantine, mined straight from the abyss. Impenetrable, and some say once used by Satan to seal his mortal enemy inside the gates of heaven
That was the Ministry-approved story. But now he gazed upon golden letters outlined in bleeding onyx: Ministry of Melancholy Academy. Above the letters loomed a giant iron eye, bleeding black chains that dripped onto the words below
The most prestigious school in the nation. He sighed – softly. He didn’t want to start a chain reaction that would disrupt time in the surrounding area. Not again. 
The Fate bros trailed behind and locked eyes with him, shaking their heads. They mouthed something then slipped into the sun. They walked off and Jude smiled – glad he didn’t have to deal with them further. 
He immediately looked around, and one girl stared at him with eyes wide as if she had seen a phantom streaking in colour. She ran inside, piercings ringing like alarm bells. 
Dammit, not again. 


The school raven rang its mourning bell, summoning three successive caws, each drearier than the last. The academy’s floor was made of tiles of black and white, as if walking on a simulated chessboard. 
On the walls were artworks in deep pencil of the most prestigious graduates of the academy named Masters of Melancholy. Each had a title underneath their portraits—an epithet granted by the garden. 
‘Jude!’ one of the teachers snapped a cane against a white tile. 
‘It sorrows me to see you, Miss Ash,’ Jude replied, looking down towards the ground. 
‘That’s better,’ she grieved, ‘we can’t have a student of this academy seen smiling.’
Jude lifted his face, poised for a sigh. 
‘No!’ Miss Ash’s tone heightened briefly before it returned to that of a grieving widow, ‘don’t sigh again. Just get to class.’ 
Jude looked down and smirked internally. Gets them off my back every time. He looked up and straightened his face. Time for poetry class.
He stepped into the classroom. A sea of black robes and alabaster hides stayed glued to their desks. ‘Mourning Miss,’ Jude grieved. At least, he tried to. 
The Sorrow would have raised an eyebrow but instead tapped her cane on the floor twice – a signal to sit down immediately. 
Jude looked over to a girl at the front whose eyes were dead, wearing a pin with a scythe upon it. His heart beat faster in dulcet tones of longing. 
He walked to his seat at the back of the class, passing an old friend playing his Grimtendo Twitch beneath the desk. His eyes were also sunk beneath the ocean of despair. Valentine… You used to look so much happier. What did the Garden do to you? Jude thought, pulling out his ashen chair and sitting beneath the eye shaped clock above. 
‘Good mourning everyone,’ the Sorrow said without moving her lips. 
‘Good mourning, miss,’ the class replied, like a bed of souls upon the River Styx. 
‘I despair to inform that it is time for your poetry assignment,’ she said, looking around the class. 
There was no reaction, even the wind stilled. 
Then, as if they all shared a single brain cell, they all pulled out their phones. 
Better do the same, thought Jude, lagging slightly behind. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and… Dammit. I ran out of battery. He looked up and hid the panic from his face – a skill well honed. 
If I’m not first, then I can just quickly write one now. 
‘Desparia, you’re down,’ the teacher called to the girl wearing the scythe pin. 
Desparia rose and trudged to the front, eyes fixed on the checkered floor. Frowning, he let his pen surge across crinkled paper while Desparia’s muffled verse bled through the silence.

Roses are black,
Violets are too,
Emotions attack, 
And pain must be subdued.

There was no applause, only the caw of a sole raven perched up on the windowsill. 
‘Well done, Desparia. You will not fail,’ the teacher praised. ‘Jude, you’re down.’ 
All right – here goes. He cracked his knuckles and brought the crinkled sheet to the front of the classroom. He looked around and all their heads were sunk low, glued to their poems. It’s always easy to perform in this class.
‘This one is called: A Shaded Star.’
	
A star cloaked, flickering bright,
Its warmth real yet out of sight,
Its shine wrapped in abyssal blight,
Yet why does my chest feel so tight?

The shaded star, a cursed glow,
Chaining tight my heart’s flow,
In the Styx now it seems to row,
A hidden light buried further below

I walk far under night’s embrace,
To find my star’s solemn face,
My heart beats in sombre bass,
Upon the journey that blights our race. 

Silence. The raven didn’t caw. What happened next, Jude hadn’t expected. The class all looked up and met his eye. There was colour. There was life. And then a single tear dropped from each of their left eyes. 
Oh shit, Jude thought, looking towards his teacher. 
She tapped her cane six times – a signal of the end. 
I don’t think I can sigh my way out of this one…
