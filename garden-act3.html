        Garden of Gothsemane

        Act 3
        They stood in a hallway of aching black lights, swaying like bells of melancholy and casting a grim glow across the ward below. Doors lined both sides of the corridor, each pulsing with glimmering light that contracted like puppet heartbeats.
Jude poked his head inside one of them and saw a classmate of his – dressed in colour and a blonde ponytail – talking to doctor who was at a screen in the corner of the room. Neither seemed to notice him enter.
‘Ria, what do you want to be known as?’ The doctor asked, not looking at the girl on the bed. He seemed to be entering something into a database on his computer. 
The National Identity Register. Something twisted in Jude’s stomach. Just another cage. 
He walked towards the window of the room and peeked outside to see the ever present eye watching through the glass. 
He turned to see Ria looking around with more emotion than Jude had ever seen, but she was skittish and jittery. Her eyes swept over the room, looking for any source of comfort but they eventually settled on her lonely lap. ‘I want to be known as Noct, just like Ariana!’ She smiled — forced and bright — and the sight sent a shiver down Jude’s spine. 
It wasn’t the tone itself that had bothered him, it was the despair inside her eyes. The despair of being forced to choose a label like a scar. 
Ria… you’re more than that. You don’t have to be someone else.
‘Very well,’ said the doctor. The room flashed pale blue. Ria looked up and her smile had died. ‘I shall update the registry. The Ministry will be grieved to forever call you Noct.’
In her arms was a box labelled Noct. She clutched it like it was her entire self.
You’re more than that box. That box is only one facet of what you think you are…
He looked back at Ria who kept on repeating the term Noct like a mantra, the box flickering in glimmers of apathy. ‘She’s lost and instead of helping her they give her box and move on…’ he said, shaking his head. 
He exited the room slowly, only to run into Fate waiting outside. ‘Seems like this is where the Namings occur,’ he smiled as usual, but even he was taken aback by the eerie lights pulsing underneath their breaths.
Jude nodded, but his eyes felt just as empty. Would there be a label that would alleviate all my burdens – help me belong? He shook his head and moved towards the next door. 
Fate grabbed him, ‘What’s the point, you know what they’re trying to do!’
	‘I know what they’re trying to do,’ he removed Fate’s hand from him, ‘that doesn’t mean I don’t want to see things for myself!’ Jude exclaimed, his voice reverberating throughout the ward.
	Fate’s smile almost faded, and Jude saw something flicker in his eyes – emotion raw. But it disappeared under his smile. 
	Another form of repression… 
	He pushed past and entered the next room, finding another classmate he knew. A boy by the name of Valentine. We used to play games together… until he stopped feeling anything for them.
	‘What do you want to be known as, Valentine?’ The doctor asked. The doctor’s voice was the same as the one from the other room. He didn’t look up — just kept staring into the black-blue light of the screen.
	‘I don’t know. Everyone wants to be something — like they have to be. But how am I supposed to carry that forever? I don’t even know what I want for breakfast tomorrow.’ Valentine held a pillow close to his face, muffling his words. 
	That sounds like him. I liked how scattered he used to be… Now?
	‘Forcing people into identities at a young age, not letting them grow and experience the world,’ Fate words echoed within a glass house. 
	Jude raised a hand, tired. Just let him finish… 
‘Why not make life more interesting. More accepting. It makes everyone unique to be referred to as something you know. It will help you belong!’ 
	Valentine played with the pillow a little more and thought a while, looking towards his Grimtendo Twitch on the bedside table. ‘Fine. I’ll be Vince. Or Vamp. They’re my favourites anyway.’
	‘Very well. You’ll carry their legacy — their memory — from now until the end,’ the doctor said, smiling faintly.
	Once they gave you an identity… you stopped caring. I miss who you were.
	Jude wiped a tear from his eye, and he looked towards Fate who also seemed disturbed. He wiped his eyes beneath his glasses – smile strained. Jude wanted to ask if he was okay, but he knew he’d only get bravado in return. 
	Jude kept walking — but felt the pull of a door. This one, he knew, he had to see. He glanced at Fate who shrugged his shoulders and Jude entered the room. 
	The scent of lavender drifted into his virtual lungs, clashing with the sharp antiseptic leaking from the doctor’s shadowed face.
	‘Desparia, what do you want to be known as?’ the doctor said as Jude glanced over at the girl on the bed.
	Desparia sat hugging her knees, her face hidden behind a curtain of frizzled hair.
	She didn’t answer.
	‘Come on, you know you have to do this,’ the doctor said, still basking in the screen’s glow. ‘It’ll help you belong,’ he added — soft, serpentlike.
	‘I just don’t want to be lonely anymore. Mum left. Dad too… I have no one. I don’t want to fit in. I just want them back.’
	‘Ah, don’t worry about that. When we’re all done with you the pain will all go away.’ The doctor smiled.
	Desparia looked up. Her bloodshot green eyes caught the screen’s light through tears.	Jude could only stare at them. She’s never looked so alive. I didn’t know. She never said a word…
	‘Reaper,’ she whispered. ‘So I’m closer to them.’
	I always thought the name fit… but how can they let you carry the title and not the pain?
	‘Very well,’ the doctor grinned. ‘You are now a Reaper from now until the end of time.’ The doctor stood up and faced Jude for the first time. His voice shifted to the same digital cadence of the eye from before, ‘See, the Garden rids people of their pain. Pain is pointless and inhibiting to society’s potential. Emotion impedes productivity. Grief is wasted output. We function better without such trifles.’ 
	Jude bit his lip and ignored him, walking over to a notebook on the side of Desparia’s bedside. He opened the front page and saw a poem etched in bloody ink. 

Mother mine, fallen angel,
Father mine, shield of light,
Without you both, life is painful,
With each thought my chest becomes tight.

I hate this pain, it drowns me much, 
Without you both, I can’t get up,
I still remember every little touch,
And each morning when you filled my cup.

Your smiles are gone and mine is too,
I can’t seem to shake this mire,
I want someone who knows me true,
Until then this life I retire. 

	Jude set the notebook down, eyes wet. This is what poetry is for. This is pain. This is beauty…
A box labelled Reaper appeared in her lap. She held it lightly as the same name stamped itself over her notebook — smudging the poem to nothing beneath sterilised ink.
Tears slipped from Jude’s eye, washing the ruined page. In that moment, Desparia looked up — and their tears mirrored each other.
	The doctor clicked his finger and the room vanished, leaving only a portal behind. The eye outside trembled as the world itself seemed to shake. A giant tear welled in its eyelid, reflecting a primordial fear buried deep within. 
	Jude and Fate shared a glance with each other as the doctor faded into data. They’re afraid… They’re afraid of emotion. He clenched his fist and took a heavy stride forward. They disguise it as a kindness, but in reality, it’s the fibres that weave their thread. 
Jude smiled, resolved and ready, as he walked into the final portal. 


The sky was wrapped in flickering ashen light, rising like a spotlight toward the blinking eye above. Its eyelashes were thick with bleeding eyeliner that cried chains of fate that descended towards Jude and Fate. 
	They stood atop a pillared altar on top of a lone pillar reaching above a misty void. Black lightning cracked above muted thunder, which laughed in rhythm beneath them — soft and murderous.
	This is it, Jude thought, meeting the irreverent gaze above. This is the end of the Garden of Gothsemane. 
	‘You have walked through the stages of emotion. You have stood in Gothsemane. You have seen the broken...’ the Eye spoke in simmering judgement, echoing the same, callous voice as the doctor before. ‘Surely, you understand that world functions better under our design.’
	It was not a question. The Eye wept black chains — serpents that slithered around their feet.
	The serpents hissed in unison, repeating their questions.
What do you want to be known as in our world? 
Don’t you want to belong?
Wouldn’t life be easier without pain?	
‘That’s not a life worth living!’ Jude screamed to the hollow sky.
	Fate also joined him, shouting, ‘We smile through the pain!’ 
	‘That is not an acceptable answer.’ The serpents began to make their way further up their legs, now coiling round their knees. They tightened their grip asking only one question this time as if it were the only one needed. 
‘What do you want to be known as in our world?’ They asked again, narrowing with a bellowing squelch, but this time Jude’s stomach remained steel.
Jude thought of his friends. His classmates. His parents. Is this what they all went through? I don’t blame them for choosing to numb themselves… He let his arms go limp. 
The Eye smirked. One last time... ‘What do you want to be known as in our world?
	‘That’s not an acceptable question,’ Jude growled, ripping the serpents from his legs. They recoiled and hissed and narrowed their slitted eyes.
	The eye began to narrow into a serpentine slit, bleeding tears of black decay that leaked desolation upon an already broken world. ‘You will remain here for the rest of time. Until you answer the question. Until you choose to belong in our world.’ 
	Jude turned. Fate smiled — and the serpents scattered. What was your plan for getting out of here?’ 
 ‘I told my Fate Bros to take the VR headset off after an hour or they heard people coming to check on them,’ he said with indefatigable confidence.
	Jude almost laughed, but it was difficult to show joy when under the heavy stare from the arbiter of control. ‘Fair enough. But hasn’t it been longer than an hour?’
	‘Yeah…’ Fate scratched his head. 
	‘You think your bros got caught?’ 
	‘I… I didn’t think of that,’ Fate replied.
	This is the creator of Smile University… Jude scratched his head. ‘You got something to write with?’ He asked.
	‘Why?’ 
	‘I’ve got an idea.’ Jude smirked. 


	‘Right,’ he said, cracking his knuckles. He lifted Fate’s SmilePad and reread the holy scripture he had penned. Then he looked up — meeting the Eye with unblinking confidence. ‘I have an answer for you.’
	‘Oh, has Gothsemane finally broken you?’ The eye replied. 
	Jude smiled, ‘No. I have a poem for you. It’s called The One Who Smiled in Gothsemane.'	The Eye narrowed in bloodshot rage. Serpents fell from the heavens — but nothing could stop Jude from pouring his soul into the poem.

Abyssal streets rife with masks of despair
Eyes bounded by gravity's sombre veil
Moonlight glittering under false prayer
Where cawing crows silence our inner wail
Even a blush is an unholy grail
I write beauty ever seeking the light
I hide my art, afraid of the pale night
Yet all I want is to live free and frail
My sighs have power and emotion I ignite

	As Jude bellowed the final line, serpents coiled round his neck — but the Eye shuddered, cracking in digitised decay. The serpents broke away, repelled by the poetic light.
	‘That was… powerful,’ ‘That was… powerful,’ Fate said — his body beginning to fade into data.
	‘It’s only the start,’ Jude grinned, cracking his knuckles as they faded into streams of data. 

	
Jude awoke in the same room as before, surrounded by unconscious guards. His head throbbed, and his eyes still saw digital chains swirling around him. He looked up — the Eye still hovered above.
He closed his eyes and breathed deeply. He opened them to see the Eye had gone. He turned and saw Fate stumbling to his feet.
	Around him were the Fate Bros guarding the door, ‘Why didn’t you wake us up?!’ he yelled.
	‘Has it been an hour?!’ They all said in unison. One of them checked their phone. ‘Oh… I forgot to set the timer. Was too busy watching SmileCam.’
	Jude cleared his throat. The room fell silent. They looked at him with reverent gazes — his calm smile dissolving their frustration.
	‘Hey Fate,’ he said with serenity, ‘any chance you can log into your account on HuskTube and start a live stream?’ 
	Fate, usually all bluster and bravado, was also calm. He shook his head and apologised, ‘I was banned from Husktube… I can’t help you.’ 
	One of the Fate Bros raised his hand, ‘I have about a million subs, we can stream on mine!’ 
	‘Perfect. I want to finish the poem — The One Who Smiled in Gothsemane,’ he said, eyes gleaming with quiet serenity. ‘This isn’t for money or fame. It’s for the love of the craft.’
	Fate’s smile wavered and faded into genuine humility, ‘Fine. I respect you Jude, you’ve got balls.’
	One of the bros launched the stream and handed the phone to Jude.
	Here we go, he thought, clearing his throat. I hope this matters. But does it? He looked toward the anticipatory gazes fixed on him. All I have to do is perform. That’s all I ever wanted.
‘Welcome HuskTube to a very special, forbidden poem. My name is Jude Noir. I was sent to the Garden of Gothsemane, and I came out without a title. I remained who I was. The Ministry of Melancholy could not get to me and, today, I shall show just what they’re afraid of.’ 
He breathed in deeply and closed his eyes, thinking back to all his friends that he had lost. All the emotions hidden beneath shades of commodified black. ‘This one’s called: The One Who Smiled in Gothsemane.’
	
What shade is black without colourful thought?
What is a poem when grief is but dream?
Night beckons our soul towards comfort sought
Eyeliner and piercings, a hollow scheme
Sadness seductive through hollow livestreams
Grief repurposed packaged in chained profit
The true self beneath gone, cast to Tophet
Tearing those who love seam by fearful seam
I want to write, love and hurt just like a prophet.

The computer sparked as its circuitry began to fry. Lights flickered on and off. Colour bled into the air, pixel by pixel. But Jude remained focused — lost in the poem.

I know there is pain but through that is love
Your eyes are so hollow yet hide such light
We must rise and feel against those above
Open your eyes and seek emotion’s sight
The abyss no longer grants us our bane
The Ministry can drown in its false blight
You all suppress the true strength of the heart
We have forgotten its flow in our veins
Now proclaim with me, let’s all smile in Gothsemane!

	There was silence. They all looked at Jude as the colour and light fluctuated in a storm of rebellious melancholy, but even that soon began to fade. 
Around Jude, the Fate Bros broke into tears — as did the unconscious corpses below. Jude raised the camera to his face. 
‘Let no silence. No society erase our right to feel.’ 
And then he smiled — an effulgent light that recoloured the world once more.
	For once, his smile left him lighter than he had ever felt.
	The video was banned within seconds — but passed even faster by the people.
Some who watched suffered. Some prospered.
	But all of them felt.
	And they began to call him the Lightbringer.
